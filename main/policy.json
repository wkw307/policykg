        "abstract": "This standard describes test procedures for amplifiers and preamplifiers that are used with semiconductor, scintillation, and proportional detectors in the spectrometry of ionizing radiation. It supersedes ANSI/IEEE Std 301-1976, IEEE Standard Test Procedures for Amplifiers and Preamplifiers for Semiconductor Radiation detectors for Ionizing Radiation. The title was changed because the same amplifiers used for semiconductor detectors are applicable to other types. In this standard, measuring procedures are given in greater detail because with modern amplifiers, perceived performance often depends on the details of measurement. Tests that are specific to amplifiers with time-variant pulse-shaping filters are not included, nor are tests for pile-up rejectors. Time-variant filters allow shorter pulse-shaping times than linear filters for the same signal-to-noise ratio, and pile-up rejectors block pulses that overlap earlier ones, allowing higher count rates for a given spectral-line resolution. Both techniques have the greatest application at very low energies because wide pulses must be used to optimize the SNR, and at high energies where detector artifacts cause low-side tailing of spectrum lines. The pulse width at 50% of peak amplitude is the main amplifier indicator of shaping time because this parameter best allows a performance comparison among different amplifiers. Compared with other parameters, this one is the easiest to measure accurately with an oscilloscope and pulse generator.",

        "abstract": "This IEEE Standards product is part of the Color Books family. System protection and coordination serve to minimize damage to a system and its components, thereby limiting the extent and duration of any service interruption occurring on any portion of the system. The IEEE Buff Book deals with the proper selection, application, and coordination of the components that constitute system protection for industrial plants and commercial buildings. The IEEE Buff Book presents complete information on protection and coordination principles designed to protect industrial and commercial power systems against any abnormalities that could reasonably be expected to occur during the course of system operation. The information is arranged in a convenient step-by-step format for easy comprehension. It is a valuable sourcebook for use at the system design stage, as well as in the modification of existing operations for better system protection. The IEEE Buff Book supports the goal of system protection by efficiently isolating and removing problems. In achieving this goal, certain design features must be utilized. One of the main design features involves the rapid isolation of the affected portion of the system, while maintaining normal operation elsewhere. Another design feature reduces the short-circuit current to minimize damage to the system, its components, and the utilization equipment it supplies. Yet another design feature provides alternate circuits, automatic throwovers, and automatic reclosing devices. These design features for system protection are the focus of the IEEE Buff Book. The errata sheet is available on-line",

Further, the standard enables the creation of algorithms that can rapidly evaluate compatibility amongSCMs and quickly perform spectrum management tasks such as finding reuse opportunities or optimizing spectrum assignments to maximize spectrum utilization. To achieve this goal, the SCMs must be sufficient in that the algorithms can perform these functions using the models alone without dependence on external databases of system or environmental characteristics.",

        "purpose": "This recommended practice is to be used for guidance in the design of power systems with nonlinear loads. The limits set are for steady-state operation and are recommended for worst case conditions. Transient conditions exceeding these limits may be encountered. In any case, the limit values given in this documentare recommendations and should not be considered binding in all cases. Because of the nature of the recommendations, some conservatism is present that may not be necessary in all cases.This recommended practice should be applied at interface points between system owners or operators and users in the power system. The limits in this recommended practice are intended for application at a point of common coupling (PCC) between the system owner or operator and a user, where the PCC is usually taken as the point in the power system closest to the user where the system owner or operator could offer service to another user. Frequently for service to industrial users (i.e., manufacturing plants) via a dedicated service transformer, the PCC is at the HV side of the transformer. For commercial users (office parks, shopping malls, etc.) supplied through a common service transformer, the PCC is commonly at the LV side of the service transformer.The limits in this recommended practice represent a shared responsibility for harmonic control between system owners or operators and users. Users produce harmonic currents that flow through the system owners or operators system which lead to voltage harmonics in the voltages supplied to other users. Theamount of harmonic voltage distortion supplied to other users is a function of the aggregate effects of the harmonic current producing loads of all users and the impedance characteristics of the supply system. Harmonic voltage distortion limits are provided to reduce the potential negative effects on user and system equipment. Maintaining harmonic voltages below these levels necessitates that-- All users limit their harmonic current emissions to reasonable values determined in an equitable manner based on the inherent ownership stake each user has in the supply system and-- Each system owner or operator takes action to decrease voltage distortion levels by modifying the supply system impedance characteristics as necessary.In order to allow the system owner or operator to control the system impedance characteristics to reduce voltage distortion when necessary, users should not add passive equipment that affects the impedance characteristic in a way such that voltage distortions are increased. In effect, such actions by a user couldamount to producing excessive voltage harmonic distortion. Such passive equipment additions (that lead to undesirable system impedance characteristics) should be controlled by the user in the same manner as current harmonic-producing devices operated by the user.",
        "scope": "This recommended practice establishes goals for the design of electrical systems that include both linear and nonlinear loads. The voltage and current waveforms that may exist throughout the system are described, and waveform distortion goals for the system designer are established. The interface between sources and loads is described as the point of common coupling and observance of the design goals will minimize interference between electrical equipment.This recommended practice addresses steady-state limitations. Transient conditions exceeding these limitations may be encountered. This document sets the quality of power that is to be provided at the point of common coupling. This document does not cover the effects of radio-frequency interference; however, guidance is offered for wired telephone systems.",

IEEE Std 1149.1 structures and methods are intended to test static (dc-coupled), single-ended networks. They are unable to test dynamic (ac-coupled) digital networks, since ac coupling blocks static signals. Differential networks are also inadequately tested by IEEE Std 1149.1, which requires either the insertion of boundary cells between the differential driver or receiver and the chip pads (this often creates an unacceptable performance degradation), or insertion of single boundary cells before the differential driver and after the differential receiver (this reduces controllability and observability to the point that many board assembly defects cannot be detected). IEEE Std 1149.4 structures and methods are intended for testing analog networks, and in most cases are not able to test these newer digital networks as well. Specifically, IEEE Std 1149.4 provides the opportunity to inject dynamic (time-varying) or analog signals for test, but these structures intended for analog testing are often too intrusive (too high an impact on performance and pin count) for high speed chip designs, and require additional resources and test application time not otherwise required for testing digital circuits. Finally, very high-speed logic imposes new restrictions on test structures that were not considered in IEEE Std 1149.1.",

It defines six classes of 1149.7 test access ports (TAP.7s), T0-T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building on that of the lower level classes. Class TO provides the behavior specified by 1149.1 from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered system. Class T3 supports operation in either a fourwire series or star scan topology. Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin interface. The two-pin operation serializes 1149.1 transactions and provides for higher test clock rates.

A precise definition of the meaning of the language components allows a model developed by one individual or group to be understood by another. Second, IDEF1X users must be supported in practice by automated tools that record and validate the models. Tool developers need a precise definition of the language so that their products assist users in applying the language correctly and allow exchange of models, at the semantic level, with other tools.The purpose of IDEF1X as a modeling technique is the same as that of all modeling techniques employed in system analysis and development efforts, that is, to plan, build, or use systems and information systems in particular, it helps to understand the meaning of the concepts involved.

Discusses some of the assumptions made in using various models and presents the fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing. Covers, generally, the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.",

These concerns are addressed by this guide by documenting typical levels of these aspects of voltage quality and indicating how to improve them. Other documents that treat these subjects in more detail are referenced.",

        "abstract": "This guide is intended to facilitate the interoperability of distributed resources (DR) and help DR project stakeholders implement monitoring, information exchange, and control (MIC) to support the technical and business operations of DR and transactions among the stakeholders. The focus is on MIC between DR controllers and stakeholder entities with direct communication interactions. This guide incorporates information modeling, use case approaches, and a proforma information exchange template and introduces the concept of an information exchange interface. The concepts and approaches are compatible with historical approaches to establishing and satisfying MIC needs. The IEEE 1547trade series of standards is cited in the U.S. Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this guide is one document in the IEEE 1547 series. This guide is primarily concerned with MIC between the DR unit controller and the outside world. However, the concepts and methods should also prove helpful to manufacturers and implementers of communications systems for loads, energy management systems, SCADA, electric power system and equipment protection, and revenue metering. The guide does not address the economic or technical viability of specific types of DR. It provides use case methodology and examples (e.g., examples of DR unit dispatch, scheduling, maintenance, ancillary services, and reactive supply). Market drivers will determine which DR applications become viable. This document provides guidelines rather than mandatory requirements or prioritized preferences.",
